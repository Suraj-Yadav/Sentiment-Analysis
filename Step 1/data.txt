+	[Wow. Great TV. It was very easy to set up. I wish the remote synced a little better with my cable company DVR so I could dispense with the DVR remote. The UHD is really amazing. Just look forward to more programming.]
+	[You can't get anymore TV at this price.  The next best thing would be an extra $1,000 more!  Samsung is the only TV brand I'll buy.]
+	[This is a very nice 4k UHD TV. What I would like to know is how to calibrate it to get the optimum picture quality. Any suggestions for settings?]
+	[Excellent for the price (1500).]
+	[Love this TV. Clear Bright Picture.  4k is unbelievable.]
+	[This has excellent picture quality, especially for the price, but be prepared to make exchanges to get a good set. Mine had a bright blue stuck pixel despite the fact that the 55" has much fewer problems than the 65".]
+	[Had this TV for about three weeks and so far this thing is amazing! The picture is so clear and as long as it doesn't have any problems in the future it was the best purchase I ever made. If only my wife thought the same.]
+	[This television is amazing - I feel like the actors are in the room with me - Superb image quality.]
+	[Great quality picture and sound! Easy to set up and use the extra features.]
-	[I didn't touch the stars for rating. So the 5 stars is incorrect.  If anything I would give it a one.]
+	[Great picture quality, excellent connectivity. In this price range you can't go wrong.]
+	[Makes my 55inch 1080P look like a 32" TV of the past.]
+	[Another great product from Samsung. 4k is truly spectacular.]
+	[I have had the set for over a month now and I am very pleased with my purchase.  This set has the best picture I have ever had and there were no issues at all with the setup.  The only disappointment is the remote which is just too basic.  I wish it had buttons for channel entry.]
+	[Great set, great picture, lots of features, remote needs an overall design improvement but is very functional. Mainly disappointed that it only lights up partially, don't know what the designers were thinking.]
-	[Purchased our Samsung LED three months ago.  Today (Super Bowl Sunday) the picture went out.  Having to have a repair service from Samsung sent out but it is the weekend.  I started reading and am now wondering if I made a good choice.]
+	[Amazing. Not overly impressed with 3d function. But everything else is amazing]
-	[Picture went out several times to a blank screen. Had to tap gently on the side for picture to appear. The picture would stay on for a short period before going blank again.]
-	[This TV looks amazing.  The built-in smart-tv apps play 4k UHD content from netflix and amazon.  The only downside is there is some tearing when playing ps3 and ps4 games on it.  I tried going into "game mode" but it didn't really help.]
+	[Best TV I've ever owned.  Superb picture quality and flawless delivery and set-up.]
+	[I spent many weeks evaluating every TV available and am so glad I chose this one.  It is fantastic.  The picture looks like you can walk into it and it delivers everything they said it would.  I would recommend this TV to anyone.]
+	[Obviously, a great buy and magnificent picture! Spend some time exploring the e-manual lest you fail to discover all the things it can do.  Finding 4K media is a bit of a problem and of course it costs more.]
+	[A Black Friday deal and well worth it.  I paid $2K for it and the next week it went back up to $2.3K a real bargain... but I see it is now down to $2K again.  A TV that is worth every penny.  I had a nice TV anyway that this is a marked improvement.]
+	[Unbelievable picture quality - operating system has great features - could not be believe the improvements made in Samsung over products offered five years ago - the $1,497.99 sale price made this a great buy - looking to add a bar speaker]
+	[Mom loves the TV, comes with lots of apps, easy to use menu, plex is a plus. everything looks great.  Samsung has the best pictures on their 8 and 9 series TV's.]
+	[Netflix and chill sessions have been pretty great with this TV recently.]
-	[Customer Service would not fix the warranty issue with my current TV.  You buy Samsung because you think you are buying from a quality name brand that will last you longer than their cheaper competitors, apparently that is not the case.]
-	[Was returned do to led lights that were visible on the 4 corners ,read on the JS8500 thread on avs forum and you will read a lot of people complaining about this light bleeds also the many return that they do in order to get a good one. This specific model suffer from this issues.]
+	[Great tv love the colors you can see the difference between the two]
-	[Both the package and the TV were damaged :( It looks like somebody fell on the box or somebody dropped it .]
+	[We love this TV, so real.. images are so close up.  Can't say enough.]
+	[I bought this item during Thx-giving and  everything went fine. So far happy with my purchase :) Good quality TV for the price. The transaction went smooth and shipment went fine. Thanks for making these available through Amazon.]
+	[Excellent TV and beautiful picture!]
+	[Awesome. Great UI improvements.]
-	[Meh, It is ok I guess.  Still not great when there is movement and it is a darker scene.  Maybe that is the TV, maybe it is from streaming from Amazon/Netflix]
+	[BY FAR THE BEST TV I EVER OWNED THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURE WAS EXCELLENT RIGHT OUTTA THE BOX EASY SETUP GREAT REMOTE AND THE ENHANCED DELIVERY SERVICE FROM AMAZON WAS EXCELLENT NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM A BIG BOX STORE]
-	[Beautiful picture.  Hope it lasts! :)  We have had trouble with a line appearing down a couple of our other TVs and hope that doesn't happen to this one.]
-	[Second time I buy a TV from amazon Waterhouse and I really not happy]
+	[Great image! Beautiful design. Just wished was frameless.]
+	[This TV is great. Everything looks so real. Takes some getting used to since my last TV was a LG plasma and it looked so bad. I am using monster black platinum cables.  4k looks amazing!]
-	[Excellent picture when viewing the TV directly. Washed-out effect occurs when viewing TV from an angle.]
-	[Well the tv seems real nice but I wasn't able to set it up because the remote wouldn't do anything but turn the tv on and off]
+	[Great TV. Picture quality is amazing. No light bleed or blue spots. Very happy with this set]
+	[I’ve had it for 3 weeks, love it so far.]
+	[This tv rocks!  This is the best tv that I have ever owned and the 4K and 3D are amazing.  I love it.]
+	[Very good product.  Performs beyond my expectations.  Haven't had any problems once it was programmed.]
+	[Honestly, the best TV I have ever owned.]
+	[Hand made by our benevolent God himself! No words come to mind as to describe how surreal and vivid the pictures this TV provides! I watched 300: Rise of an Empire the other day and I am pretty impressed about how it turned!]
+	[WOW!  This picture is so clear and perfect it is like you are in the same room with the people on TV...takes a bit of getting used from our older TVs...but would never go back...picture-wise, this TV is the best I have ever seen.  Would recommend a sound bar...sound leaves much to be desired!]
-	[I forgot to do a review but it's been at least 5-6 months now and it's still kicking. It does not get hot when gaming just a little warm nothing a cooler couldn't fix. The screen quality needs work but it's durable when you’re using it. I mean really who sits the side of their screen when in use?]
+	[So far I love this laptop.  I am a "Mac" person, but Windows 8.1 and a touchscreen really is a pretty good experience.  The graphics card in this laptop is outstanding, and the stereo speakers with a subwoofer are excellent.]
-	[Defective hinge. Lenovo replaced the first laptop I received with said hinge, but the second one had it too. Lenovo has been good about replacing it but this is not the quality I expect from a $1000+ laptop (or even one that cost $500 frankly).]
-	[Hinge broke like all the others. Replaced the broken hinges and two months later they broke off again. I will never by lenovo again!!'n]
-	[Bottom left corner looks like it was pressured at one point. Didn't catch it until after the return range.]
+	[Has good gaming specs and is the best VFM among Y50s offered. Would need another 8 gigs of ram though.]
+	[This is a great laptop. I have no complaints at all with anything about this product.]
+	[It has worked great for me so far! No problems with anything.]
+	[The touch screen is awesome！Hope the SSD could be bigger.]
-	[Had the same hinge problem as others after only 6 months.  It has made this laptop almost unusable.  The quality of this product is absolutely laughable and Lenovo will do nothing to support it, buy from a different company.]
-	[never buy this. the same issue with others. the Hinge is cracking !!! And the lenovo don't care about that. the physical damage , the warranty not cover. never trust lenovo again and never buy the products of lenovo.]
-	[I have this computer and there is an issue with the hinges, I would recommend staying away from this laptop if you are looking for something that will last.  A sleek design isn't worth much when the hinges that are suppose to hold it all together crack.]
-	[For the amount of money I would rather build a pc for the same price but 2x better. The battery is worse than the 4hours they said (lenovo). I wouldn’t even want to take it anywhere afraid the battery would die to quick whilst I game.]
-	[Be careful buying this laptop. I bought one about 5 months ago, and in that little amount of time the screen has shattered due to a design flaw. I highly recommend that you pick another laptop if this is one of your options.]
+	[I started using this computer as soon as I got it, and I can say that it's a HUGE upgrade to my old laptop. 60 frames is way better than 20 on batman arkham origins.  Also, GTA V on ultra settings is amazing,....just saying]
-	[Hard drive issues and no support from Lenovo. It's not worth the risk. I have had this computer close to a year and the month after the warranty expired the hard drive started to act up and now my computer is crashing.]
-	[The laptop itself is great, if you get a working piece. I got one with a defective 860m gtx and it has cost me a lot to simply get it to warranty repair. It's a matter of luck really what piece of hardware you get.]
-	[we are using it, but I really can't stand the way the needed tabs appear and disappear.  I really don't like some built-in shortcut will cause your curser to jump to some other place.  Would not recommend.]
-	[Great Device, Cheap, BUT bad 1. Bad Wifi 2.Bad GPU integration 3.Bad Bios EXTREMELY bad support from Lenovo will never buy a lenovo "gaming" laptop ever again.]
-	[If you are a movie watcher or gamer, stay away from this laptop, because its screen is just unbearable. Also its sides and corners are so spiky, it is hard to use it on other than a desk or a table.]
-	[Cons Cons - It's fine if you are not waiting the batteries survive for more than 1 hour!!!! -Very hot -Too Heavy Pro -Touch works wonderfully -keypad]
+	[Only reason I am giving it 4 stars is due to the god awful touch pad. You have to click and icon like 20 times before the damn thing works, other than that great laptop for gaming.]
+	[I'm yet to find a problem with this laptop except that the WiFi does not work optimally with a 2.4GHz UTStarcom modem/router. Great look. Feels like a spaceship😀😀😈😈👿👾]
+	[I'm in love with this laptop! So far I have no complaints and I've had it for a few months. It's been working great for my online classes and gaming! I definitely recommend it!]
+	[Best laptop for the money period. The only touch laptop that has real gaming power for less than 1500... Super thin. Good battery. what else do you need?]
+	[Would recommend to buy this in y50 series as it does have touchscreen functions which will be useful for the new Windows 10 update.]
+	[Great laptop, but as with other reviewers I don't trust the hinge to last and am not pleased with the internal battery.]
-	[Beyond frustrated. Only had the laptop for a few months before the hinge snapped. Will never buy Lenovo again.]
+	[Met all my expectations. I can play Witcher 3 on medium settings and do my online course work. Very satisfied!]
-	[Expected a Faster computer, but I think that the HDD RPM is the reason why. I'll be changing it soon]
+	[Eon I love my new Lenovo lap top... Great price and a quality computer.]
+	[Amazing laptop...should have save to get the better version :(...anyway still love it]
+	[good laptop for its price. it's more than what I needed for home and editing.]
+	[I'm no computer expert (yet), but 140+ fps on CS:GO? That's pleasing to see.]
+	[Great notebook. Powerful and beautiful. Shipped with an external DVD-Writer]
+	[I love this laptop besides for the fact that the screen reflects EVERYTHING]
-	[This laptop has a defect (manufacturer/design flaw). Not completely happy!]
-	[Computer was good but the battery won’t hold a charge for some reason.]
+	[Quick delivery and amazing graphics card. This is a great computer.]
+	[It's cheaper than our country, about 20%, I love it , excellent!]
+	[I can't stop playing games and using Autodesk Maya. Great!]
-	[Garbage.  Hinge torqued out of alignment in about a month.]
+	[Excellent computer, great sound, graphics, everything...]
+	[Good price，good quality。It will be better with SSD]
-	[The battery life is just too big of a downside for this laptop. Unless you are going to keep this laptop plugged in all the time, . The processor is superb. Applications open quick and everything about the laptop is very responsive.]
+	[The sounder is amazing. Love the keyboard.]
+	[Really nice computer.  Delivered quickly.]
+	[Great laptop and great speed for games.]
+	[This computer is amazing so far!]
-	[Decent computer but wi-fi is slow and glitchy. Came loaded with bloatware and a factory installed virus(easily removed). Touch screen works very well.]
+	[Much bigger than I'd expected. Also, makes weird self-cleaning noises and other exercises out of the blue. However, it does print very, very fast, and the quality is good. The replacement cartridges are expensive, but that's an industry-wide thing.]
+	[Great printer so far. It's very fast, I like that it holds a full team of paper and so far I think it will economical with ink though the cartridges are very expensive. First impression is that they will last a long time but that still remains to be seen.]
-	[Worked great, no problems, but it died after 18 months.]
-	[Does anyone else have issues with tray #1 not working?]
+	[All the info I found on youtube indicated this was a fast machine. It is.. I print a lot of labels, and enveloped too. No problems so far.]
+	[Great printer!  Probably more of a printer than I needed for the home, but I tend not to purchase printers often and starting a home base business wanted one that I knew would last and be fast enough and offer the scanning, faxing and coping options that I would need.]
-	[pain to change double side and to revert to single. Buy the laserjet version color quality is better. I have both]
+	[Seriously love this printer! Super easy to set up on the network, prints great, FAST, good life out of the ink cartridges, quiet....it is essentially perfect in every way.]
-	[I like the printer, but not as fast as advertised and extremely noisy. I cannot hear anything when it is printing.]
+	[This is the fastest printer I’ve ever owned. It’s so fast that if you use glossy paper the ink doesn’t have a chance to dry before it ejects and can smudge.]
-	[This is the second one of these I bought, because the first one broke after one year and one week.  This new one came and I've already had to call HP 3 times to deal with "printer failure" and flashing lights on and off.  Very disappointed in this product and HP.]
+	[Fast, economical, I find it does everything I need in my small office. I liked it so much I bought a second one for my home office.]
+	[The best printer I have ever owned!]
+	[Very fast and print quality is great as long as you use ink jet paper]
+	[These printers are lightening fast and the cartridges last a long time.  I have ordered 2 of these for businesses I do work for.  They both seem to love them and I have got no complaints.]
-	[Horrible. Worked very well for almost 8 weeks, then stopped working altogether.  I have contacted HP for help, and they sent a replacement part which did not fix the issue.]
+	[I've had a lot of HP Printers over the years, but this one is the best so far.  There haven't been any disappointments as far as quality of print, print spend.]
+	[Best printer I ever owned and have been using it for over a year. super fast, ink tanks last a very long time and I print  a lot for my company. I would highly recommend this printer.]
+	[Love it. Concerned about replacement cartridge cost, but the printer is the best I've ever owned.  Print Speed is unbelievably fast.]
-	[Great price. Great service. Great product for the first three weeks. All of a sudden my computer (Mac) can't find the printer. Tried reaching out to HP Support, but that's been a nightmare. Help!]
-	[Great idea but bad printer. Don't waste your time. To start with the ink is more expensive than the printer itself. Get ready to drop 450 for ink. I have had a problem with this thing since the day we bought it. I bought it when it first came out for 750. Huge mistake.]
+	[Great product, worth every penny.]
+	[I like the printer and it does all it says it does, but it squeaks when printing.  A very high pitched squeak almost like something needs oiled.]
-	[Excessively large and difficult to set up on your own network. Very fast printing of first page, love being able to insert a full ream of paper. Display lacks good integration into the product's function. Hopefully the ink lasts as long as claimed.]
+	[It is nice to have a printer that works. This has never failed to perform yet. I enjoyed it so much, I bought another 576dw. Other printers appeared to work and then would fail, this one never has]
-	[We have had this for 1 year and now told the jets are bad and that it isn't fixable.  HP says they can't help us to buy a new printer.  Any ideas?]
+	[So far, so good!  This machines does it all fast and efficiently.  👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻]
+	[HP is back! This printer is ultra fast, efficient, and sturdy. The print quality of my business documents is superb, although no photographs have been printed. I purchased the additional XL cartridges which, based on reviews, should last me through the end of 2016.]
+	[The printer arrived shortly after I had ordered it.  It is a huge improvement over my previous printer.  The only thing missing is an attached stapler.]
-	[Yet again another Hewlett Packard printer from a long line of HP printer products that seems to work well initially, but within 1 year the wireless functions completely disintegrate.  We will be trying a new brand after a longtime loyalty to HP. Pro:  Great ink usage.]
+	[Excellent printer - great price and value.  Does a great job for our small office.  Especially like the wireless feature.]
+	[It's fast, and printing quality is excellent.]
+	[I love this printer - this is the second one I have purchased for our office.  Great printer for great price.  Estimated delivery was 5 - 10 days, but I received it the next morning!  Literally 20 hours after I placed the order.  Good job, Amazon!]
+	[Great printer. 4 stars just because I don't know how long this product would last compare to the laser printer that we have used for 4+ years.]
+	[It's in my personal office so no one else can mess with it!  It's a great product, the print apps work great]
+	[Gotta tell you, I am in love with this printer! The cartridges are expensive, but the quality and speed of the printer is wonderful. I highly recommend it!]
-	[A little over 1 month of light use the printer is malfunctioning.  It prints out garbled characters that wasted an entire tray full of paper and the wifi went from working to partially working to not working at all now.  I hope I'm able to get a refund or exchange for this item]
+	[It's a lot bigger than I expected but, way faster than my previous HP Color Laser Printer, better print quality and quiet.]
+	[good printer, works well so far]
+	[WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRINTER.]
+	[I am very pleased with this all in one and would recommend it to any one running a small business. Definitely a good investment.]
+	[Great product! Prints fast, Copies, Scans to email and USB. It comes with ink for 3,000 pages. You can't beat the print cost per page.]
+	[This printer is great, the colors are really sharp and the ink last a long time.  The only difficulty I encountered was when I tried installing the software in the computer, it was really slow.  However, after it was finally installed it began working like a charm.  Worth the purchase!]
+	[LOVE this printer so much, I bought a second one. very economical!!! and FAST!!! SIGH, I'm in LOVE!!! Print quality is NOT the same as my laser, but more efficient and quicker. great for regular office paperwork, but would use my laser for presentation or promotional quality printing]
+	[Love the features e-print, Android and iPhone print wirelessly.  Fast printing as well.  This is good for business use, if you are purchasing as a photo printer you would not be happy with the prints.]
+	[On time and exactly as described.  a Five Star review.]
+	[school classroom use...fast, quiet, reliable. worth it! :)]
+	[Best Printer it’s a work horse, very reliable very few jams if any. HP great job]
-	[This unit interferes with another HP printer (HP 8610) that is on the same network. To get either printer online with the correct printer IP address requires that the computer be turned on before the printer.]
+	[I love the printer. It is fast and quite. I would caution be aware for the replacement toner cost. One bundle if 970xl Black, 971xl magenta, 971xl Yellow, and 971 Cyan is around $450.00]
-	[What happened to attachment to characters, Ubisoft? Much better than the recent games, but still way off the mark and lacking.]
+	[Great game play and the movement improved from previous version but the storyline is still very weak]
-	[I was disappointed to learn that there is no multi-player co-op.  meh.]
+	[This game is a nice addition to the AC series. The single-player campaign is well done. The glaring omission of any multiplayer mode takes it from 5 stars to 3 for me.]
-	[It's okay. Still lots of glitches and poor controls. If more time was spent ironing out all of the bugs it could have been a much better gaming experience.]
-	[Got stuck in a tree and have yet to been able to get out. Nice time period though.]
+	[Oh boy another Assassins Creed game........... It's fun just like the others but I'm really getting tired of the same old thing. I won't be buying this game but it was worth the rent.]
-	[Has possibility to be great but still too many glitches]
-	[Heavy profanity with no way to filter.  The game could be a 4-5 star otherwise.]
-	[This game is horrible! Terrible controls, horrible kidnap missions, glitchy, no ability to jump off of a building, graphics that are PS3 level. Avoid this one, the franchise is dead.]
-	[I don't see any point why this game is interesting. So painful and boring... Why they make this stupid game lol. Horrible story every play. Don't buy. Trust me.]
-	[Game was not in package! It was a scam!]
-	[Story is good but everything  else sucks pretty  much  u can either have a little knife or a chain  character  goes everywhere but where u want to  go you will get stuck because  of  that  same thing as unity but with a useless grapple gun]
-	[SAME STUFF OVER AND OVER AGAIN! As soon as I saw there were micro transactions I returned it, bought matches and logs, started a fire and slowly threw small bills into the flame! At least it was more entertaining than wasting my money in this game!]
-	[Save your money for fallout 4 if you want to play this game just buy one of the 29 other Creed games in the bargain bin, punch yourself in the junk, set 50 additional bucks on fire and I'm sure you'll get the same experience.]
-	[Terrible, Unity is way better Edit: I finished the game and it still sucks. I am trading this in and buying black ops 3 when it comes out]
-	[Plz do not try this item. Phone ringing sound is very low. U cannot hear the sound when the phone rings]
-	[Very slow, often takes 15-30 seconds changing screens, which is totally unacceptable for making calls and taking pictures. Many pop-up ads and no way to stop them. Blue Tooth stopped working properly after a few weeks. It is OK if you have very low requirements for a phone.]
-	[Well I got 2 phones one for me and one for my wife and all I got to say is my phone won't even get pass the lenovo boot when turned on so can use it at all. Hers works and she loves it a lot so good news there. I will rate better if I was able to use the device.]
-	[I’ve got one but the problem is when I down load a movies all the apps are gone. Only lenovo pictures remain I don't know what happen and also my videos. Picture no more]
-	[I can't even use the phone, it won't let me go through the whole set up because it keeps saying WLAN stopped working.]
-	[Had bad virus android Trojan fakes spy when I bought it. could not get rid of it.]
-	[Phone didn't switched on. Not got charged.]
-	[I bought the phone waiting for a month. The phone has many inscriptions were in China .Google play did not work in his place was lenovo store in Chinese .telefon had to send back to China.]
-	[DO NOT BUY AFTER 1 WEEK PRODUCT STOP WORKING AND PHONE HAS LINES RUNNING ACROSS SCREEN.IF I TRY TOUCHING THE SCREEN, THERE IS NO RESPONSE.PLEASE DO NOT BUY]
-	[After 6 weeks and still no phone, Can’t wait no longer, buying something else.]
-	[Really a bad experience. Will never want to post any more order in future. Poor experience.]
-	[Internet speeds are really bad even in Dallas where my old $40 phone had amazing speeds this phone is not good at all]
-	[I have a several problems with the camera. The telephone freeze and I need to take off the battery to use it again.]
-	[Speakers are very poor Pictures awful To many adds, about cell phone companies or even pornography.]
-	[Worked well for the first month or so, slowly developed touch screen problems and now left half of the touchscreen is non operational. Very disappointing with that. No USA warranty centers too so I'm out of luck.]
-	[This cellphone doesn't work with LTE (4G) bands of the USA. The only bands supported for American LTE BANDS are FDD-LTE 2100/1800/2600. It will work only on 3G Bands]
-	[This very good phone except the 4G sim didn't work it's only 3G so please don't advertise as 4 G cell]
-	[This was one of the worst quality products I have ever purchased. After only 2 weeks of usage the device will no longer accept a charge from the power adapter. Very poor quality.]
-	[This stopped working after about a week. It was great until then.]
-	[The sound is great but I can't charge it with its charging cable. So after the initial battery ran out, it is DEAD for good. If I knew this is a disposable bluetooth speaker, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.]
-	[I wish I would have known that this doesn't pair with ipod nano 7th gen. Great idea, unfortunately incompatible with my mp3 player.]
-	[I bought this with the intention of bringing it places like the beach but unfortunately it doesn't work when it's not plugged in (malfunction?) and it doesn't go too loud]
-	[I ordered this speaker hoping to listen to music in the shower. It is not waterproof, it is only slightly water resistant. Otherwise the mislabeling, the speaker works well. If you are looking for a legitimate shower speaker, do not buy this one.]
-	[The sound quality is not the greatest, but it's definitely loud. It fell off the wall in my shower and stopped working. I had to take it apart and reconnect a wire. It fell off the wall again the next day.. It's not very durable but it connects well to my phone and the controls work with no problem]
-	[Mehhh... it's ok.. The sound quality isn't that great. I guess it's good for its price. I recommend this: http://goo.gl/Ut2Vo1 .. I like the sound quality better, it has built in mic for speakerphone and other fab features, you can submerge it in water plus  It offers lifetime guarantee.]
+	[It is an ok Bluetooth speaker, not as loud as I expected a speaker this size to be. The buttons are also pretty weird. I’ve been much happier with smaller, less expensive models made by a different company. Either way I guess the soundbot will work till I can find another I like more.]
-	[Arrived with about 50% battery. Connection was spotty from the beginning, but the real problem was that it wouldn't charge, like at all. In the end, I got maybe 3 hours of poor performance, then threw it away after several days on the charger with no results. Real disappointment.]
-	[My Iphone plays louder music than this speaker! Thought maybe it was because it needed to be charged but even after a full days charge it is so pathetically quiet. What's the point? Bought this as a gift and because it is past 30 days I can’t return it. Waste of money! Terrible!]
-	[First one showed up and did not work. Emailed tech support and they replaced at no charge. Product seems to work fine now. As others have noted poor speakerphone but OK speaker for shower and price. Not sure of long term durability as first one sent failed almost immediately]
+	[The sound quality is very good. I can pick up when someone is calling using the speaker. However after not even a week of having this speaker, the suction part of it doesn't work. It won’t stick to the wall anymore. I would give it a 5 star but that really disappointed me.]
-	[I loved this when I first got it. It was loud, and it worked perfectly. However, after about a month or so, the device would not hold a charge for more than 25-30 minutes.  You get exactly what you pay for. Now the device does not even provide enough juice for one song.]
-	[Got this for my kids to use in the shower. They said it worked pretty well, but the battery life was lousy. Too much hassle for us. It was $20, so I'm not shocked it had drawbacks. I like to buy these cheap products and hope I get a gem. This wasn't one, sent it back.]
-	[The speaker on my phone is much louder... I got this as a shower speaker, and can barely hear it. When my phone is on high, and 4 or 5 feet away from the show I can hear my phone better, clearer and louder.]
-	[I loved this speaker until I tried to charge it the second time. It just won't charge anymore.  The sound was loud enough and I never had an issue with it falling in my shower.  Kinda sad. I'll send this one back and try another one and hopefully update my review]
-	[The removal parts twisted after I washed by dishwasher. See the images I uploaded. It is no dishwasher safe as they claimed.]
-	[It does everything I want it too except it won’t juice spinach or kale, the blade runs too quickly to juice them and they just get chopped so disappointing there]
-	[This is a piece of s***.  After a week’s use plastic bits started to get into the juice.  Threw it away.]
-	[I bought this juicer, when I juiced carrots and apples I found the pulp to be very wet, so wet I was able to scoop it up and squeeze juice from it... your pulp is supposed to be dry.... I would not recommend this juicer]
-	[Bought this in a hurry, and then 6 months later tried someone's Breville Juice Fountain. If you can't find Breville in your hometown, be patient and buy it online. It is only $50 more than this Cuisinart, and so much better quality.]
-	[Over the course of 10 days the machine became increasingly noisy. On the last day I am assuming the spinning blade/ filter contraption started to lift while in use and proceeded to grind off the bottom of the food pusher.]
-	[It takes up way too much space, buy a smaller model because you are not going to use this size unless you are standing in the kitchen juicing for a large crowd in which I hope you have two refrigerators because this beast doesn't make much juice without a garden of fruits and veggies.]
+	[This juicer is ok. Wish I had gotten a Breville. this juicer is kind of annoying to clean. It has too many pieces. It also does NOT juice greens well at all. I had a BReville before and sold and was trying to upgrade but even the cheapest Breville is better than this juicer.]
-	[Honestly I use this Juicer every day sometimes twice a day... the juicer works well only as time goes by, I started to noticed a lot of juice in the waste bag ... so may be the blades are giving up to quickly.... I only had it for about a month, when all this started...]
-	[I returned this item. It is of poor design, Most of the added ingredients end up in the pulp chamber with very little juice and it is a pain to clean. I cannot believe that this item is still being manufactured.]
-	[Blade went dull after three months. Won't cut spinach or parsley any more.  Basket is very difficult to remove for cleaning. Lots of nooks and crannies for schmoots to hide in and fester.]
-	[This machine seems well built but it is going back. The pictures clearly show that it is grey but the unit I received was black. Amazon needs to change/update their pictures.]
+	[This is a beast of a machine!  It works great!  Clean up is another thing!  There's a lot to do to clean this thing up.  Cleanup is the only drawback and the reason for 3 stars.]
+	[Easy to use. Not as difficult as I expected to clean. Previously had a Breville that was more cumbersome to clean. Did not produce as much juice as the Breville.]
+	[the first week I worked perfect, then would not relight, I live in Venezuela and bring it to an authorized service center and they would fend equipment warranty]
+	[Excellent juicer, but a lot of parts to clean up after.]
-	[Does not produce enough juice. A lot of pulp is wasted]
-	[The juicer experience is not for me - The product is nice but I missed the blender bite - I like the extras not only the juice - Not to mention my cheapness compulsive disorder - Throwing away the pulp felt like was throwing away my money. The juice is nice though - Buy it if you like.]
-	[This stopped working after 1 month.]
-	[This juicer has been a nightmare to clean because the filter basket is nearly impossible to remove. We have to use a screwdriver to try and leverage the basket off its base. I bought a Breville Juice Fountain and am thrilled with its design and it is a breeze to clean.]
-	[Bought this as a gift for my BF and he complains that it takes too many fruits and veggies to get enough juice for a drink/smoothie.  The pulp is still pretty wet, not dripping, after juicing.  I assume the clean up isn't the easiest b/c he never cleans it right away.]
-	[I did not do my research before purchasing this juicer. While it does is job as far as juicing goes, the pulp is very very wet, which is where all the nutrients are. It is fast, easy to clean and gives me juice. But I will purchase a more efficient one in the future.]
-	[Does not fully extract the juice from the pulp.  Does not discard pulp into waste container as efficiently as one would've expected, especially given its advertised power.  Otherwise it's a pretty good unit. No real complaints.  Just being picky I guess.]
-	[It works fine on softer fruit.  However, we wanted to make apple juice.  It did make juice, but left a lot of juice in the pulp. I had to clean the machine after only getting about 2 cups of juice.  This is not for someone who does a lot at once.]
-	[It's nice, not too loud but did leave some moisture. It’s a chore to clean. I learned the hard way to peel everything first, yuck! Overall it does the job its intended for if you’re willing to clean up the mess.]
-	[Not the best juicer I ever used. Kale didn't juice and ended up in whole pieces in the side canister. The $99 cuisinart juicer juiced better than this one. Not worth the money. Wouldn't recommend this model.]
-	[I bought this for my daughter.  It juices very well, but it is very, very loud and she lives in an apartment complex with thin walls.  She sent it back because of the noise factor.]
+	[The juicer is ok. Wasn't looking for anything special, but it left the pulp a little wetter than expected.  Clean up is easy and delivery was super quick.]
-	[It works fine, although my new juicer was missing the foam management filter disk. Nowhere to be found. Put a blemish on my overall thrill about it.]
+	[Very good juicer although I am a novice. Says that it is quiet. Mine was quiet the first 2 times, after that it was really noisy... =(]
-	[the grinding basket wouldn't seat correctly and it ground up the plastic tube.  I am returning it and hopefully will get reimbursed.]
-	[Doesn't work as well as the cheap one I bought to see if I'd like juicing. All the kale I put in looked the same in the waste part.]
-	[Hard to clean. The pulp would stick to the inside and was hard to clean. This makes me think twice about using the juicer]
-	[loud... hard to lock. like the color &amp; style. just not for my family. love the brand. it works fast also.]
-	[It worked great while it was working. I have had it less than a year and it just stopped running]
-	[I used it twice the first time it was great. The second time it stopped working.]
-	[Loved machine but it took to much fruit and veg to make a pitcher of juice.]
+	[Great.  Does everything it says it would do. Very happy.  Easy clean up too]
-	[Why I smell the burned plastic in my juice? Could you answer my question?]
+	[Excellent juicer, but it creates a mess and is very difficult to clean.]
-	[doesn’t extract enough juice. pulp is still wet when using apples.]
+	[Too difficult to clean properly  works well  fairly priced]
-	[I am sure this unit is equal to its competition but it is just not that good.  You will waste more time and product trying to make juice with this type of machine. If you still want it give me a call - I'll give you mine - it's just taking up room in my pantry.]
-	[Luckily I got a really good deal on this.  The first thing I made was orange juice.  I had to peel the orange, then cut it up.  The worst part was that it took me an hour to clean the machine!!! I just gave it away yesterday.]
-	[Stalled the second time I used it-sent it back]
-	[I thought I was going with a good name brand. Well not much thought went into the design. Not enough juice before it seems to plug up and throw away too much product. Also the plastic does not clean up well.]
+	[Out of the three juicers I have my favorite is Omega juicer which cost $100 more than Cuisinart and Breville but worth it. The pulp comes out dry like bone means you get every drop of the fruit and veggies.]
-	[It's not what I expected. Too much pulp.]
-	[does not come with the filter disk]
+	[Hard to clean but does a good job!]
+	[I would love to buy few more]
+	[A must buy you Have to pick this up the best VR HEADSET I EVER OWNED SEEING IS BELIEVING SPREAD THE WORD SAMSUNG HAS ARRIVED APPLE SUCKS!!!!]
+	[Mind blowing, I really have no words to describe how amazing it looks. If you have a compatible device get it! I would however recommend getting a blue tooth controller along with it, I personally just used my PS4 Controller I have laying around the house.]
+	[I am extremely impressed with my Gear VR!  Lots of available apps, pretty comfortable headset and better than expected video quality.  VTime, a free VR social networking community, is one of those "I didn't know this was possible" experiences you don't have every day.  A great buy at a great price!]
+	[What can you say it's a must if you have a galaxy flagship, for people that may think is an overpriced google cardboard I have one thing to say and that is the oculus store.]
+	[I have this and the note 5 and it's amazing I had the S6 and traded it in after seeing what the screen Dorr difference was I opted for the bigger phone and don't regret it at all. The Galaxy Note 5 is the best phone of 2015 along with best new hardware of 2015 in the Gear VR]
+	[Its not perfect, but for $100 and a cell phone it’s pretty darn ridiculous. It’s a cheap way to get a taste of what the future of 3D looks like. You will truly be astonished at some of the scenes and games. I can only imagine how much better this is going to get.]
+	[Incredible!  You can see where things are going.  VR has the potential to be a true game changer.  I thought this was just going to be a gimmick.  I am SOLD and excited for the future in VR.  Sounds like 2016 may end up being a big year for the technology.]
+	[This is just a must-have for current model Samsung owners.  The experience is amazing, comfortable, easy controls, and the Occulus app store.  At the $99 price point I am very satisfied.]
+	[Love it! It's like you’re in a different world!]
+	[Has problems such as overheating and fogging up. With a microfiber cloth the fogginess is easily managed. Even with its problems, It's the best mobile VR experience available. Virtual reality is finally for real and it's totally worth the $100 if you already have the phone for it.]
+	[Nice and different. Very easy to use. My only complaint is it only last maybe 3 to 4 hours tops before you have to take your phone out and charge it. Also it makes your phone get really hot. But thankfully you can't feel it while you're in the goggles though.]
+	[My first review after buying hundreds of products on Amazon over the years. This thing is incredible and a must have accessory for your Samsung phone. I have a 6 Edge + and it works just fine. Took it to work...co-workers amazed! Just get it... trust me!]
+	[I bought this for my son for Christmas and so far it's pretty sweet. They do fog up quickly if not properly acclimated to the room they are being used in but I found a little bit of Rainx interior anti fog wipes solves the issue. Great product.]
+	[Fantastic! Watching 3d sbs video files (dropped on the phone in the Movies/3D/ folder) and youtube (on Samsung's exp. browser) 360 vids  just fine. A 3rd party app lets me use Google cardboard apps. It's a great step forward for VR!]
+	[Got this for Christmas and definitely enjoy it. No overheating issues on my end. I have successfully ran the Gear VR  for over 3 hours with no issues watching movies. Just have to clean the lens every now and again.]
+	[Now, watch Netflix,  and YouTube from Samsung gear VR is just awesome. ...so many more games, and apps are available for VR as well....lighter than previous VR sets....more comfortable,  and more clear. .]
+	[I was skeptical about buying this because it seemed way too gimmicky (cough hover board) but this thing has exceeded all expectations and is only $99. I just wish I knew more people with android.]
+	[Now, watch Netflix,  and YouTube from Samsung gear VR is just awesome. ...so many more games, and apps are available for VR as well....lighter than previous VR sets....more comfortable,  and more clear. .]
+	[I was skeptical about buying this because it seemed way too gimmicky (cough hover board) but this thing has exceeded all expectations and is only $99. I just wish I knew more people with android.]
+	[This is SO cool. I don't think I've ever said "WHOA!!" more times in my life. Exceeded my expectations. I can't wait for this tech to really take off. This is the next step. So. Cool.]
+	[Freaking awesome! Really cool and fun for everyone. Graphics are amazing, really easy to use, and is really futuristic. So cool, buy it! I have the Galaxy Note 5 and works great.]
+	[It was a great gift! My friend got 2 of them so I sent mine back. Watching this is really great! The only complaint is that it over heats your phone in about 20 minutes]
+	[Single most impressive first party accessory for a phone. it is a unique experience and by far the best way to own your own VR headset. Amazing value for the price.]
+	[Totally blown! If you don't have these you are missing out on the latest and greatest thing to ever happen in the gaming industry! You will be 100% satisfied!]
+	[This is an awesome piece of hardware! Just make sure your device's firmware is up to date and you'll have a blast with this.]
+	[Was a little scared that 1GB wouldn't be enough, but so far it is faster than my iPhone 6 Plus without any problems with multitasking. Great phone for the money, highly recommended.]
+	[Headphone quality and external speakers are very good. Solid built phone doesn't look or feel cheap. Stock Android is clean and fast. I have no problems with this phone. Look forward to Motorola in the future. Spending $400 or more on a phone is unnecessary really.]
+	[This phone does everything I need at a reasonable price.  I used it to replace my aging Galaxy S2.  Took a while to find out where all the options were and get used to the latest android version.  Voice quality is great and connectivity features like Wifi, Bluetooth and GPS work flawlessly.]
+	[Bought this phone to replace my iPhone 5s. This phone works just as smoothly as the iPhone, has a great screen, and the pure Android OS is great. For most people there is no reason to buy a more expensive phone. I got the 16gb model with 2gb of RAM. I wouldn't get the cheaper model.]
+	[Excellent quality build phone! a lot more bigger than you expect and definitely ALOT better looking in person! highly recommend this phone to any android please! I recommend buying the 2GB Ram and 16GB memory model on Motorola.com but overall phone is FANTASTIC!]
+	[This phone is a great buy feels solid in the hand and is a very good budget smartphone . I believe it is worth more than the price . The phone runs smooth no lag at all . I love my black version and would recommend this phone to anyone .Great job Motorola]
+	[The Moto G is an outstanding phone for the price point. Great feel, function and screen. I returned an iPhone 6 in exchange for this and don't regret it. Would buy again without hesitation.]
+	[Good phone, 8GB it's fine for my mom, front camera is 5mp, the android OS is update, has a lollipop and marshmallow is guaranteed.]
+	[Great deal for the money. No junk software installed, just plain old android. Seems well built, screen quality is excellent.]
+	[This listing actually IS the Moto G 3rd Gen. 2gb/16gb model. I just received two of them. They're charging now, I haven't set them up yet.]
+	[This phone is very nice and has a good H.D quality, it’s great for very messy people because it is waterproof, I love it :)]
+	[Love it. I had the 2nd Generation and went for this because of the water resistance. Fast and pure android beats anything.]
+	[Best phone for the money that I have ever purchased. Excellent battery life and even better camera.]
+	[100 % satisfied, the item is in very good condition. Thank you very much. I love the camera.]
+	[Everything's perfect, at least for now. Thanks]
+	[this might be the best smart phone I ever had, Amazing, my last few phones have been a couple of iphones, I think the last one was the 5s, then a Galaxy note 2, great phone, my favorite until the moto, I bought also a Blu life pro, (terrible phone) and now the Moto, I think I am in love]
+	[So I was a bit hesitant to buy....but I did my research and read up on this beauty.....n purchased her. Couldn't say I regret.....superb so far....best decision I've made to buy this phone. Was looking for an upgrade and very happy that I waited a litle for the moto g 3rd Gen.]
+	[Very good, fluid and fast phone in spite that it’s a budget phone, but it’s the best budget phone available...I am very happy with it, I used to go for very expensive flagship phone but this is pointless for me now, this one handles all my daily tasks very well...]
+	[I purchased the 16GB model since it has 2GB of RAM, overall I'm very satisfied with this. The price is reasonable for what you get and it doesn't come with any junk, I would purchase this over a similar priced Samsung any day it's far better.]
+	[It is a great phone for the price.  The display is not as good an AMOLED but is better than average.  OS is nice and snappy even with only 1 gb of ram.  I believe that this is due to the vanilla install of Android 5.  No complaints so far!]
+	[I purchased this phone for my wife as she had dropped her LG G3 and could not be happier. This phone is fast and responsive and keeps up well to those phones on the market now. Also, the price really cannot be beat for this phone.]
+	[Finally found a phone I understand!!  I do not do email on my phone but do text &amp; make calls.  You can hear the people very clearly which my other phones did not give me that.  I never lose my signal. Great phone for this Senior.]
+	[Great phone for the price.  Arrived on time, nice design and easy to hold.  I like the shape and design of these Moto phones.  The camera is very fast and nice to use.  I just like everything about this phone for this price!]
+	[You cannot underestimate this phone. It is the KING of sub-$200 phones. Big screen, Nice volume, great motion features, durable, waterproof. Basically I am a previous Iphone owner and I Love this phone.]
+	[We finally replaced our old Tracfones with these terrific Smartphones from Motorola. Couldn't be happier with the size, photo quality &amp; versatility ~ love being able to get mail &amp; on the internet with ease.]
-	[This product would have gotten a good review.. but I only have this for about two months now and its shutting off at night when charging due to overheating. When this issue is sorted with Motorola, I will update my review.]
-	[I think they're refurbished, bought 2, one has a soft burn sign in the screen where you usually swipe your thumb when scrolling and the other one, with moderated use, by the afternoon battery is drained. Now the price make sense.]
-	[The phone is great however my headphone jack does not work. I tried multiple wired headsets to no avail.  Will return and replace.  Will update rating if headphone jack on new phone works.]
-	[What is the warranty provision on this phone. It is less than 6 months old and the touch screen is coming off.]
-	[Phone is great. But battery drains very fast. Battery can't stand even for one day with internet usage. Memory is not at all sufficient]
-	[Some of the apps run slow. Such as snapchat, I must go to the mobile store soon to see whats wrong Update september 1, 2015 The battery only lasts 4 hours moderate use... It gets hot quickly... Most of the apps are running slow and there are times the brightness lags. Skip this phone]
-	[My phone seemed to start acting up about two months in - always froze when using apps overall. I had to do factory reset and not download apps such as facebook so it would be somewhat faster, but not satisfied with having to do this considering only 60% of my memory on my phone is used.]
-	[When I received the Motorola G, I realized that the phone was bent, so the back cover didn't fit properly. I have placed a replacement order two weeks ago, but I'm still waiting for the replacement. I hope this new Moto G is OK, without any defect.]
-	[Two stars for a good camera, but I bought this phone two months ago and can no longer hear people on the phone. The speakers work by there must be a software issue and now I'm two weeks beyond the return policy. Don't waste your money.]
-	[Good price and decent feature list. But poor performance. Battery charge level tracking is erratic. The phone hangs up often. The 8 GB internal RAM is really not sufficient. Pay a little more and buy a 16GB phone.]
-	[I loved the original Moto G, but the power button is absolutely terrible on this phone, you have to really mash it to get it to work.  It's a decent phone, but it just feels cheap compared to the first version.]
-	[Aside from the stereo sound it’s the exact same as the first Gen, processor screen etc. And it accepts SD cards. But if you don't mind those two differences then go with the first Gen and save a hundred bucks!]
-	[Touch screen isn't responsive at all. Moreover GPS position wasn't accurate while driving, even when location services were switched on along with wifi. Probably the piece we received was defective.]
-	[That cell phone did not work since the first day. after two month the phone died completely. I am very disappointed. I bought two... and the other one (the serial ) is assign to somebody.]
-	[Battery life does not last very long, kinda disappointed on this one. The phone itself is great, but volume goes from low to high and battery life sucks!]
-	[Camera doesn’t work. Keeps asking to restart camera. Nowadays, taking pictures is one of the main reasons we have smartphones. it's a shame.]
-	[The team arrived in good time and well packaged , however it presents manufactures fault with fontal horn which sounds damaged .]
-	[Wouldn't turn back on after 4 months of use. I'd expect something like that from Blu cell phones but not Motorola.]
-	[Bought this phone in Sept 2014 and now suddenly has gone completely dead.  Won't charge!  Disappointed!!!]
-	[I have problem whit this phone because this phone is locked for a red and I can’t use, you can help me]
-	[phone failed 3 months in had to send it back to motorola still waiting for my replacement]
-	[This warehouse Item was not satisfactory since phone was missing in my delivered package.]
-	[Worse smartphone I ever had. It's slower than the nexus 4 I bought two years ago...]
-	[Cellphone started turning on and off by itself since the first day it arrived.]
-	[the phone is dual sim and I did not know. Typically wanted my only complaint]
-	[I returned this camera because there was such an awful lag between pressing the button and the actual picture taking. The quality was okay, but I was frustrated when taking photos with moving objects or multiple people. There are better options for the money in today's market (2014).]
-	[I returned this camera.  I thought it would be a great little camera, but on the second day of our trip the zoom lens got stuck open. Couldn’t close it, and couldn’t take pictures.]
-	[Very portable but pics are mostly blurry. I'd return if I had receipt. Upgraded to DSLR already]
-	[It's a good deal if you are looking for a starter camera. The issue I have with the product is the grainy image on the preview screen. I had an older version of this camera and it was awesome. Next Time I will definitely go with a better model.]
-	[I returned this camera. I found that it took terrible pictures compared to any other camera I have had. I have an older version of this exact camera and it is far superior. Not sure how it is 20 MP...everything looked blurry no matter what.]
-	[Found that the camera produces low quality images when the flash fires.  Images are not sharp and the colors are off, also the images are fish-eye distorted.  My 12-year old Nikon Coolpix 3100 takes much better photos.]
-	[Pics aren't what I was hoping for that price. My phone camera snaps better pics by far. The camera settings are hard to navigate and you can forget trying to snap a quick pic, takes way to long.]
-	[This camera seems to be quite low quality. The camera is very light weight plastic.  It does not stay in focus. The LCD screen is not a bad size, but low quality.]
-	[This camera will take very good pictures until you zoom in. Then they are like big blob indistinguishable!]
-	[Camera was too cheap. Doesn't Take Very Clear pics]
-	[It's not as good as taking non-shaking pics as my  Casio did, and I’ve only  gad it since last April and now when I turn it on, it opens up and only shows a screen that lets you choose your language. I have tried to find a way to solve a problem and found 34 pages of other people's problems with it.]
-	[Bought this to have a camera on a trip and not just depend on my iPhone. At the end, comparing pix, my iPhone 6+ took better photos than this camera, so we returned it. My husband was the primary photo-taker with the camera, so there's a chance it was "user error" but who's to say?]
-	[I bought this Sony hoping for better reliability than the many Canon point and shoot cameras that I've owned.  The pictures are slightly blurry so it is going back.  I tried various camera modes and ISO settings but the pictures didn't improve.]
-	[I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the pictures. I bought it for use inside a big warehouse. But apparently the light isn't enough for this camera and most of the photos come out blurry and dark. If I could return it, I would.]
-	[The good point is its tiny and light so I can carry it around easily and the bad thing is the zoom is worse than I thought. When I use the zoom the pictures came out blurry no matter what I do.]
-	[ok as camera but movie sound is monaural--a real disappointment as a stereo feature would not have cost much to include. Takes a lot away from replay.]
-	[The camera is great but it came with a foreign wall plug and the usb charger doesn't work.... Very disappointed. I'm contacting the company today.]
-	[Not worth it. The auto focus is a big problem and the picture quality in general is not very good at all. It was a big waste of money.]
-	[2 main gripes: indoor shots were often blurry and discolored; long lag between pressing button and picture being taken when flash in use.]
-	[Arrived in time, box appears to be original, camera stopped working after a couple dozen shots.]
-	[Should have returned before the return date ended.  Not happy with the quality of the videos or pics.  My iPhone takes better photos.]
-	[The camera screen broke and I am looking for Sony w800 camera replacement screen I don't know what number should I use]
-	[Great camera but the wall charger Plug is a foreign one. I will have to purchase an adapter to charge the battery.]
-	[not happy with the picture's quality. I quit using it &amp; resume using my old canon 12 mp powershot camera instead.]
-	[Pictures are somehow always blurry. I wouldn't complain if it costed less. Simple not worth its price.]
+	[Great camera for the price. Easy to use and produces quality pictures.]
+	[Takes great pictures, easy to use all at a good price]
+	[As it turned out~~ It's everything I was looking for in a beginner camera...definitely get a good steady tripod for the long clear close ups....over all I’m very pleased!!  I love the fact that with a lil explanation to a new user, it’s very "user" friendly and takes great shots...]
+	[I don't know why people don't like this camera, it's such a great camera! $100 is such a great price! I love using it everywhere, it's the perfect size and it takes great pictures! I bought it at Target and I love it!!!]
+	[Great photo quality, not good for moving and snapping pics. Took this photo from my room. Which is so far away from the sun, so zoom is awesome as well. No filter added or anything.]
+	[This camera is great for its price, I've included several unedited pictures I have taken over the past few days to help portray the sort of quality you should expect.]
+	[First time I've bought a DSLR camera and it doesn't make me disappointed at all. I love it, easy to use with guide mode that helps me a lot.]
+	[Takes amazing photos. Great starter camera. Easy to use. Photos are crystal clear on demanding 5k display.. Wifi to smartphone feature (if you buy adapter) works great but shrinks photos so it's strictly for social media or a quick email.]
+	[This is my first DSLR camera and it is fantastic!! I am new to the hobby and this does everything and more! I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who’s a beginner and will tell them to purchase on amazon for a great deal, and quick delivery! A+++]
+	[This is my first "real" camera and it is so awesome.  I've taken it out on a week long road trip only but the 500 pictures I took came out great!  I've ordered a book to learn a little more.  But I do love it!]
+	[This is my first DSLR camera, and so far, I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I did a lot of research prior to my purchase, and I don't regret anything.]
+	[I made a correct decision after buying this camera, I did a lot of researched but this one is just perfect for me, the photo quality is unbelievably sharp and crisp. It’s really easy to shoot and the guide mode really does the job. Highly recommended for anyone!!!]
+	[This is my first DSLR camera and I have to say that is has everything that I  have expected plus!!]
+	[I absolutely love this camera! Now granted I am an amateur photographer, but for me as a started I couldn't be happier!]
+	[Easy to use in Auto mode. A plethora of features. Super fast shutter response and long battery life. My only criticism is that I believe the manual could be written more clearly.]
+	[I've been a photographer for over 45 years, owning many cameras.  This is a wonderful camera.  It does virtually everything that the high-end models do, at one-tenth the price.]
+	[This camera takes beautiful pictures. I am so thankful we finally purchased it. You don't have to be a photographer to take amazing pictures. This camera is all you need.]
+	[Excellent camera.  Can be simplified for some household members, but has the ability to be used more professionally by me.]
+	[Great product, but I returned this one because I found a better bundle price at Costco ( with two lens kit for $499).]
+	[I am just starting with DSLR so decided to get advised by my photography teacher and without a doubt, his advise was the best. This camera takes great shots on the right hands.]
+	[Great camera and easy to use.  If there is anything I would complain about it is the ease at which you can get into the point-and-shoot mode when the camera has so many features.  I recommend the book David Busch's Nikon D3300 Guide to Digital SLR Photography as a companion to the purchase.]
+	[We are new to DSLR cameras and have found this to be a great entry level DSLR. Has enough features to meet all of our needs and help us learn in the process. We got the wireless adapter and love that for transfer to phones and remote control. Highly recommend]
+	[Way better light sensitivity than the D3200]
+	[I am a complete novice and have a lot to learn about this camera- but it was easy to set up and use! I purchased the Altura Photo Speedlight flash kit with it- both worked well together. Pictures were fantastic! LOVE this camera!]
+	[I got it as a gift for my mom. From the 1000+ pictures I keep getting sent I think she likes that it is easy to use and the pictures come out really clear. My brother borrowed it from her for a trip and now wants one too!]
+	[I work out almost daily - weights, kickbox &amp; treadmill.  These offer comfort, support &amp; an arch which has helped my plantars fasciitis!!]
+	[Just got these And love them.  The color said black and red but they are black and coral like the picture, which is what I was hoping for.  Super comfy!!!]
+	[I LOVE these shoes . I wanted a good deal on some Nikes and these are the BEST. I was a 7 in my old Nikes so I ordered a seven and they fit perfectly! I'm obsessed. I want to wear them every day, I wear them to work where I'm on my feet all day and I can wear them to the gym!(:]
+	[I work at a nursing home and I’m on the feet all day. With my last pair of shoes, my feel hurt so bad the next morning to walk. With these, my feet don't hurt at all! I love them! Would re-purchase(:]
+	[These Nike Women Shoes are an excellent shoe. Very Comfortable. And I would recommend them to any walker/runner out there.]
+	[Since nikes run small go up a size. I usually wear a 7.5 but for nikes am definitely a size 8. Super comfy love wearing them. I weight train and run in them!]
+	[I love my new Nike sneakers. The price was reasonable, fit perfectly and a great summer color.]
+	[I bought this shoes for someone else who experiencing some foot-pain, but these shoes are helping a lot! At the same time she’s very happy with the design and colors. Great product!]
+	[these are literally the best things my feet have ever come in contact with. they fit true to size and are amazingly comfortable. definitely worth every penny!]
+	[I love these shoes. They are so comfortable and super light weight. Perfect for the summer weather. Love the bright colors too.]
+	[Runs small. I'm a standard 8.5 and had to order a 9. Nice running shoe. Lightweight and comfortable. Didn't need to break them in. Ran 5 miles the day I got them without any issue.]
+	[I like the color.  There is a lot of support for the arch and there is an added small area with a shoe string along the inside.  This allows you to make the shoe narrower should you need to.  I normally wear an 8.5 N shoe and I have the 9's.  Nice fit, room to move in the toe, feels light.]
+	[Awesome! Got here earlier then posted date. The package was a little worn but as long as my shoes were in tacked and untouched, I don't care.  The colors are cute and the fit is perfect. I wear a size 7w and that's what I ordered. Definitely ordering more like this]
+	[Love these shoes! Really comfortable. One of the laces on the shoes came damage but I'm still giving 5 stars because of the great service I received from Amazon. They gave me a discount so I can buy new laces. Happy customer!]
+	[I opted for the bright pink and am in love with it! Incredibly comfortable, lightweight, flexible shoe. High quality and a good price too. Would highly recommend.]
+	[Overall design is awesome and the vibrant sky blue color the pair has is appealing to the eyes! Love to wear them whenever I run or when I go to public places.]
+	[The shoes are really nice and comfortable, Nike now has a tighter toe box so keep that in mind. But these were true to size.]
+	[I like the color and they are very comfortable ,I recommend it for people who like to run or walk]
+	[I love them but they  run a size big so if you’re a 6  order 5.5 ! other than that am in love with them!]
+	[The most comfortable workout shoes I've ever had. They are very light and fit perfectly!]
+	[Best sneakers I've ever owned. They're light, they're perfectly snug, I look cool.]
+	[This is my 5th pair of these sneakers, so great for running and use at the gym.]
+	[Comfortable. Stylish. Great for running, walking, shopping. Fits true to size.]
+	[Nice colors n very comfortable! Get compliments every time I wear them. :)]
+	[Shipped quickly, exactly what I was expecting! Very satisfied.]
-	[This product fits perfectly but looks really cheap.  Shoe is made very thin.  Not a big fan of how slick the bottoms are.]
-	[Not very comfortable. Don't fit very good and are made quite cheaply. Overall not as good of a deal as they seem.]
-	[Cheap shoes made of artificial materials, not comfortable at all. Had to return it.]
-	[Felt cheaply made, color was rubbing off on my socks, smelled like chemicals.]
-	[Why 2 star, Are nice but smell a lot a petroleum can't used no more.]
-	[Cheaper than what it looks like from the picture]
-	[They stink! I mean literally. They smell like moth balls. I have aired them out for weeks and put sachets of activated charcoal inside, but they still stink. They are comfortable, but there is no arch support.]
-	[cheap and shows. will try to sell on ebay.]
-	[The shoe needs more arch support]
-	[Shoes have a very strong chemical odor to them. Shoes look stylish, but yet to wear them. Waiting for the smell to leave!]
-	[The shoe is comfortable, but is very cheap.  The sole and leather are very thin. I won't be able to wear this shoe too many times before it will be worn out.  It is comfortable and is worth about what I paid for it, $22.]
-	[The phone works well, but the battery that came with the phone isn't able to charge because it has water damage, as indicated by the red strip on battery when I opened the phone.]
-	[Come with broken speaker for normal voice communication. This was not noted. I can still use voice communication with headset and mic or speakerphone.]
-	[Lollipop destroyed this otherwise great phone.]
-	[Went from an iphone to this and regret the change every day.  There is no smooth change over if your friends and family have iphones and try to text you.  No messages when service is down like imessages through wifi.  Not happy with the change.]
-	[Phone itself was good. Started having problems with it charging shortly after having it. Had to get a new phone within a month and a half through Verizon because the charging port was defective. Phone itself was great, other than my one issue.]
-	[Overall I do like this phone better than the iPhones. However,  this phone shuts on and off when it should be on. I am returning it ASAP never again will I purchase from this vendor]
-	[Had to return the first one. Because people couldn't hear me on a phone call. Now this one the speaker phone in not functioning properly so have to return this b one as well.]
-	[The phone came to me in "blind mode" which was terrible and I had to go to a verizon store and they were baffled. After that was sorted out I loved it]
-	[Not a bad phone. Screen is nice, and pretty fast. Returned next day for HTC M8 which I found to be a better bang for your buck, and better material quality.]
-	[I've had this phone for 6 months. It crashes and lags way more than the obsolete iPhone 4 I had before it (I had to upgrade for VPN security reasons).]
-	[The phone is difficult phone to get used too.  It did not transfer my Google contacts or o uctures from my Galaxy III.  I want my Galaxy III back.]
-	[The product didn't work!  I thought these things were checked before being re sold.  It was returned as it would not load.]
-	[Battery  dies before half my shift is over and I only work 8 hours, other than that no issues, I have noticed thus yet.]
-	[The "shot and more" feature is why I got the phone and it doesn't work. Everything else is great.]
+	[So glad I upgraded. Much much faster than the S3. Compared to the S3: Apps snap open; Windows slide smoothly; Calls are made and answered instantaneously. Battery life is also noticeably better. The size is bigger, but that's a minor tradeoff in my book.]
+	[had this phone for a week so far and I love it, great color, great battery, great features, overall awesome phone]
+	[I just received the phone and upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy Note.  The S5 is a little smaller, thinner, and lighter than the Note.  The screen is amazing WOW!  And I thought my Note had a great screen.  So far I must say that I'm impressed and I glad I purchased the S5.]
+	[Beautiful phone!!! Absolutely love it!!! At a great price, sprint the company I deal with for a carrier could even match Amazon price.]
+	[I'll keep it short, it's a awesome phone. I upgraded from a two year old Razr Maxx enough said. I bought a nice case so the plastic cover doesn’t bother me.]
+	[Great phone, better than my galaxy note phone, have to get use to the size differences, but the lg g3 camera is way better.]
+	[I upgraded to the S5 from a Samsung Galaxy Nexus. The biggest improvement is battery life. It's so much better on the S5! Love all the other features that come with the phone, too, including the new OS. No complaints here!]
+	[Works well.  I switched from an iPhone 5.  I don't really seem to have any issues switching over.  I do LOVE the micro SD memory card slot as that was my main reason for switching from an iPhone.  And I love the gold!]
+	[This phone is the iPhone killer. Large bright screen, awesome battery and super fast performance.]
+	[I have owned an iphone for the last 5 years and finally decided to make a switch to Samsung.  I can honestly say I'm so happy I did and will probably never go back.  I love this phone.]
+	[The S5 was received brand new for only $100. Sprint wanted $200 for me to upgrade to this phone I searched on Amazon and I found it for only $100 can't beat that.]
+	[Love this phone. Went from a Galaxy Nexus to this and it is simply amazing. Has great long lasting battery 1.5 + day. All the feature this has just wonderful. Not used to the Samsung launcher so changed that with Apex. Could not be more happy with a phone.]
+	[Love it. Coming from a S3 and having a Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 already, this a great addition to the Galaxy line, which has gotten better with age in my opinion. Fixed the weak points and shored up the good points. All good.]
+	[I have also owned the S3 &amp; S4. This phone did not disappoint.  I have absolutely no complaints about the S5.Amazon shipped it fast!!! THANKS]
+	[Great phone, water/dust/sand resistant. Large, bright display. Too many preloaded carrier apps. Remove them if you want more storage.]
+	[This phone does everything that I want it to do.  Very fast, great connectivity (Verizon), great battery life, and great features.]
+	[New phone @ a great price. I waited 2 days vs buying @ the local store and paid about a 3rd of the price. Phone is fantastic!]
+	[So great. Best android phone to date. I would recommend this phone to anyone interested in an android phone this year]
+	[Much better battery life than my S3 phone.  I also like the larger display. Very fast phone and good call quality.]
+	[I absolutely LOVE my Galaxy S5!!! This is one awesome piece of scientific art!!!! Samsung definitely went to another "galaxy"!!!!]
+	[An amazing phone! Upgraded from an S3, the S5 is feature rich, with faster speed,  nice camera app, bio readings and other cool features. Vastly superior to iPhone, which I used for two years. If you would like the best phone available today, the S5 is the best I have found to date...]
+	[I freaking love this phone. Really impressed with the battery life. I use it heavily all day and plug it in whenever there's an outlet available but I rarely have to worry about the percentage. Incredibly speedy phone with a beautiful display. My wife is about to get one as well.]
+	[Note 2 was a tad bit big, but this size is just right and still offers a lot of screen space.  Read some of the tech reviews for more in-depth info.  It should come standard with Qi charging due to the USB 3.0 charging port with protective cover.  I'll be ordering that soon]
+	[I'm still learning how to use this phone but so far I'm loving it. I also purchased the Logitech Pro headset to use with it, wow great pair. I haven't picked up my iPod since my purchase. I also saved over $100.00 in purchasing my phone and accessories from Amazon.]
+	[Ordered this phone to upgrade my Droid Bionic. Received it 2 weeks early and very pleased so far. Very sharp screen and has been easy to learn the functions of it. Had no issues transferring or activating the phone. Thus far I could not be more pleased]
+	[Bought these for my boyfriend, he absolutely loves them. The champagne color is awesome! They came in perfect condition and they sound incredible. Definitely worth the price! Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.]
+	[Bought these for my boyfriend, he absolutely loves them. The champagne color is awesome! They came in perfect condition and they sound incredible. Definitely worth the price! Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.]
+	[Best beats yet!!! My ears don't hurt after hours of use and sound goes without saying top notch!!!!!]
+	[Great quality in everything! Sound, packaging, battery life, and design! I would definitely buy again if I need too!]
+	[These Beats Studio Wireless headphones are awesome! The sound quality is superb and this particular color way is not only sleek and stylish but lightweight in comparison to the other colors they sell! I highly recommend this if you can get them on sale like I did!]
+	[I love them. I paid for flash and volume. And that's what I got. Louder than every other headset I tried by half. But still soft and light.]
+	[What can you say about Beats. I'm not expert but the quality sounds good it pairs easily to my iPhone and the noise canceling is great. I would recommend but the price is a little steep.]
+	[Sound is great, after a couple hours it hurts though. Use them while working out, really isolates you from the world.]
+	[Absolutely the best wireless headphones on the market. These headphones don't only sound like a million bucks, they look like a million bucks. Goes great with my new gold iPhone!]
+	[Beautiful headphone, matches my iPhone 6plus gold, sounds just as good as it looks. My Amazon Prime  got it to me on time as promised. Great service Amazon , Just love it!!!]
+	[Not as good in noise reduction as bose but more comfortable and music sounds better.]
+	[Brilliant, awesome! I already have a Beats Studio pair for my daughter so I knew what to expect. Great quality. Great wireless range. Only thing I wish for is that they would play a little louder! The sound is crystal clear and the bass is beyond belief! I recommend!]
+	[Just upgraded from the original studio beats to the wireless. Who knew removing the chord could make such a big difference. Really enjoying them so far. Comfortable, great sound and stylish. Perfect for travel and listening to jams in your cubicle.]
+	[I love listen to music with BeatStudio Wireless. I can listen to music without cable a lot of time. This product is really crazy. If I were you I could buy this one. I have one]
+	[I love these headphones.  I fly a lot and these work well to block noise on the plane, they have great volume and bass, and it’s very convenient to not have to deal with the cord.]
+	[Item came perfectly drake and prompt delivery. Everything was in original box and product works wonderful. Definitely recommend!]
+	[Authentic pair of Beats here. This is my second pair (white &amp; gold) of wireless studio's in the past few weeks. The sound is amazing and pairing is easy. I didn't realize this when I purchased but this style of headphone has a built in mic for phone calls!  Wow!  Speechless!]
+	[I love bass. And I hate over ears. Of the few over ear options that are available, I was hesitant because of the high price. This however is totally worth the price tag. Simple to use. Beautiful design. Comfortable and the sound is outstanding, especially if you love bass!]
+	[I needed a new pair of good headphones and invested in these. First off they are an amazing product that syncs with my samsung and it arrived three days before the estimated time interval even began! (Between april 1st &amp; 16th. Arrived march 28th!). Highly recommended!]
+	[These are so far the best wireless headphones in the market. Sound Quality over Bluetooth is amazing, never expected such a quality on wireless. Lows and Highs are perfect. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.]
+	[I am so happy I purchased this product!!!! I been wanting to buy the beats headphones in the past but was reluctant till I saw these new impressive wireless one's!!! I am so happy I waited and so worth the $$$$$]
+	[Got these for my 11 year old for a Christmas gift.  She got the white with red originally, but had to have the gold.  Great coloring, they look very rich and they match her iPhone.  Fast shipping.]
+	[Great headphones love the sound feels  great just a little pricey .sleek design feels good over your ear .I used them on the plane and on my ps vita and iPod . The sound is better than great.]
+	[My Beats came with a nice case. Dropped them accidently in the lake and the case floats!  Beats were dry and Unharmed! Nice quality. Love the Beats. Seller shipped fast and great packaging.]
+	[My first over the head wireless headphones and I am right on the money the moment I played first video on youtube from my s4. Snug and blissful listening experience- for long hours.]
+	[I have 3 Kindles and love every one of them.  I love how the light adjusts to the lighting in the room.  The print is bolder and easier to read and I especially love the size of the Kindle Voyager.  Perfect!  Keep up the fantastic work, Amazon!  I'm a customer for life!]
+	[Got mine at Best buy. Beautiful, display. No lighting problems at all. Unbelievable contrast and sharpness. Significantly better than the PW2. I would go ahead and order. You will be stunned at how good the display looks and how superior this screen is over other e-readers.]
+	[It was difficult to make a decision on this--my Paperwhite was doing its job just fine.  But everything I read about the Voyage just made it sound like the best of the best--and it is.  SO clear.  My tired old eyes love that.  Lightweight.  Just nice.  Really N-I-C-E.  Spoil yourself.  Buy one.]
+	[The perfect reading device, in my opinion. I love the always on light, the buttonless page turns, and the solid build quality. I was shocked about how well this devices feels in the hand considering how thin it is. The only features I would love to see in the future is USB-C and waterproofing.]
+	[WOW!  Just love this new Kindle.  I think if I had to do it over again, I would have gotten the Wifi version with 3G because a lot of times , I am reading and the book will say as I am looking up a word, "there is no internet connection".]
+	[This is definitely a great improvement from paperwhite. I read in another language and the difference is huge. Also the page press is designed for cold weather when you don't have to take off your gloves and touch the screen.]
+	[I liked my old Kindle fine, and wouldn't have thought it could be improved on, but this one does just that: It's smaller, doesn't need a reading light, has better battery life, and is just a pleasure to use. A winner!]
+	[Upgraded from 1st generation paperwhite. Worth it if you can justify the premium cost. Lighter, fonts are more crisp. Using the haptic buttons more than I thought I would. Really enjoying the device.]
+	[AWESOME is the only word to describe the new Kindle Voyage.  It is a bit smaller and lighter...and even with the Amazon-made cover on the ereader, it is light enough to hold with one hand.  And, the page turn buttons are the BEST addition yet.  Just buy it...don’t' debate.]
+	[The screen is so amazing. Cannot see the zigzag at all. I had paperwhite 1 and kindle 4. Voyage is a great improvement over these two on the screen, which is the most important factor as a reading device. I enjoy the page press feature.]
+	[This is what I wanted in the Paperwhite model (1st Generation). I'm happy I waited to get this model as my upgrade. It is flawless with an evenly lit screen and crisp fonts. The Voyage is much more responsive than its predecessor, allowing no disruptions while reading. Perfect e-reader.]
+	[Bought this as a gift for my husband who has never wanted a kindle. He is a voracious reader of books he can hold in his hand and turn a paper page. His response to me after a few hours of playing with his new Voyage, " Home Run, I really like this, Sweet"]
+	[I'm 75 years old and not very techy, so I was pleased to see how quickly I learned to use the Kindle.  It works great and the background lighting makes reading very easy, even for my old eyes.  Great purchase!]
+	[Love the new Kindle Voyage, I had read some conflicting reviews but am very happy with mine. I had an older model with the keyboard, so the touchscreen and the adaptive lighting is a very welcome addition.]
+	[There is no blue or yellow light, I have used the voyage on a daily basis. It works as it should, it is no tablet and that is not its purpose. The voyage is simply the best ereader you can buy.]
+	[Received my Voyage yesterday and read all evening with it.  I have to say I am totally impressed with this Kindle. Perfect screen clear bright even whites up and down and crisp clear text. Page turns took a bit to figure out but other than that I have to say Bravo to Amazon job well done!]
+	[Was very east to set up as a replacement of my old Kindle 2. Text quality on the Voyage is outstanding, and adaptive backlighting works very well across different light levels.]
+	[I've owned one of nearly every kindle generation, from the the first to the DX to the first (horrible) touch screen versions and I can say, without equivocation, that the Voyage is, at this time, the absolute perfect reading device for anything other than textbooks and technical papers.]
+	[The best e-reader out there. A little pricey but if you do a lot of reading then this is the one for you.]
+	[The darn thing's a marvel!  No kidding....I've had every iteration of the Kindle, and this is the lightest, brightest, fastest one yet.  No issues at all with bi-colored screens or sparkly pixels....just an elegantly designed and easy to use portal for reading.]
+	[This is the best Kindle and provides the best reading experience over every device out there!  I LOVE IT!]
+	[Ever wonder why our phones are so high quality and our readers cheap plastic junk?  I sure have.  Which is why the Kindle Voyage came out of NOWHERE and couldn't have impressed me more.  I have time for nothing but reading since I got this thing. Jeff Bezos, we salute you.]
+	[The Voyage far exceeded my expectations. The size is ideal-can't imagine how they managed to pack so much into so little space. The page turning is the best ever and while I like my older Paperwhite very much, the Voyage resolution is even better. I am sure I will never go anywhere without it.]
+	[I love how the back light adapts to any light I am in.  I love being able to read it at night without a light.  I have owned many versions of the Kindle, this is by far my favorite.  The battery does not last as long as my old keyboard Kindle, but 2 weeks vs a month, I can't complain.]
+	[Love it! Used s Kindle fire previously and the new Kindle voyage is much smaller and lighter and is better on my eyes in low light conditions. Got the amazon origami cover to go with it and works great! Already protected my Kindle from a fall from my lap to the hardwood floor.]
+	[Wonderful! I am an Apple lover and have all of the Apple devices, But reading books on a power-draining iPad was annoying. Now I carry a Voyage along with my iPhone6 and MacBook, and it's all light enough to take everywhere. The Voyage is a nice device that is always with me.]
+	[I love to read but my eyes are so bad as I get older.  I hadn't read in ages. But now, oh my, I can read again!  This sweet little Kindle enables me to download anything I want to read and adjust the text size to make it a joy to read again. I'm beyond thrilled.]
+	[Love it! I bought to take on a trip overseas. The size and weight are perfect for travel. Because I can be easily distracted by emails, notifications. texts and other such interruptions, I love the single use nature of a reader. And this one is quite nice.]
+	[I quite like the voyage. I found touch based page turns on paperwhite to be little bit jumpy, voyage fixes this in a big way. I haven't found any screen problems people are talking about. Been using for almost 1 month now, couldn't be happier.]
+	[Day or night.  No glare, no eye strain like I get from a tablet...I had a Standard Kindle reader for years and love the touch screen functions of the Kindle Voyage.  Ultimate simplicity, not over designed as some devices can get.]
+	[A few days into using and in love with it, in love with reading more than ever. I have the origami cover and just love the way this thing sits up for hands free reading. Can't wait to take it on road trips and camping.]
+	[This item is perfect for just plain reading. If you are into pictures then a larger reader and one in color will be a better choice but for reading books I prefer this over my Ipad or a larger Kindle.]
+	[such an improvement over the first generation Kindle.  Weighs practically nothing.  I'm working with the backlight set basically to zero.  Pretty much like reading a paper book.  Highly recommended.]
+	[Second Kindle Voyage that I've purchased.  Outstanding in every way - text is clear, lighting is excellent, lightweight, long battery life.  I've bought several Kindles; this model is my favorite.]
+	[This was a gift.  I love the readability of this Kindle.  The backlight adjusts to the room light and it is much easier to read than my Kindle Touch, which I also loved until I got this one.]
+	[A wonderful way to read. I really like the smooth screen. You no longer feel an edge at the bezel. Very quick and responsive. The best Kindle ever and I've owned them all.  Well done Amazon.]
+	[I love it!  It is so compact.  The big surprise was that all my books from my original, several-year-old Kindle transferred automatically as soon as I registered the Voyage.]
+	[I didn't think anything could replace the Paperwhite in my heart...until I received my Voyage in the mail...I effing love this thing, it goes where I go. Always.]
+	[I am very glad that I bought the Kindle Voyage. It especially becomes handy with the Origami cover. My eyes never get tired; brightness settings are perfect.]
+	[Awesome!!!!!! It's smaller than kindle beginner so it's easy to hold in one hand! And it's really clear to read the words! I also like the adjusting light.]
+	[I had the paper white 2. It totally worth the upgrade. Slimmer lighter and clearer. The press button design makes it much easier to read when lying in bed.]
+	[This e-reader is so great.  I am visually impaired (age-related macular degeneration and cataracts), so I love all the improvements that have gone into the Voyage.  White background and crisper print helps me read easier and faster.]
+	[First class all the way.  I loved the Kindle Paperwhite, but the Voyage takes the reader to a new level.  Crisper, brighter,  whiter...lighting that adjusts automatically to its environment. Great device worth every penny.]
+	[It took a little while to get used to the touch screen, but once you do it works great.  I still think there should be page numbers as well as location to let you know where you are in the book.]
+	[Pretty damned impressive. The technology is as transparent as you wish it to be; the experience is that of reading a book.]
+	[Completely satisfied with this version of kindle.  It replaced my original kindle and is so much better.]
+	[If I could give this more stars I would. It's my 7th Kindle and it blows the others away. I especially love the tactile 'buttons' on either side. Being able to effortlessly turn pages without touching the screen is very nice.]
+	[Since I bought my wife a new Kindle Voyage for her birthday she hasn't put it down, she loves it!]
+	[This unit is light, easier to hold, display is better and the back lighting the page is uniform.]
+	[Easy to use inside or out with the adjustment to the ambient lighting.]
-	[Why does it look that? is it supposed to look like that? the background is not completely white. I see letters in light black ink]
-	[The touch screen is too sensitive. one tap often scrolls 2-3 pages. The ON button is too small. I liked my old Kindle better.]
-	[Go for the paper-white kindle edition, cost more but worth it. What's the point of an e-reader that you can’t read in bed with the lights turned down. Had to return this for the paper--white.]
-	[the software is inferior to the old kindle unit.  too many stupid options and over complicated.  obviously designed by a non reader who has no idea of how book readers read.]
-	[Don't like the touch feature  too sensitive doesn't go where I want. Hard to hold and not have letter size change all the time !  Want my old kindle]
-	[Touchscreen is awful. Messes up page navigation all the time. Get something with physical buttons!]
-	[Good quality and nice screen, but file support is not that great. I wish it supported .epub]
-	[It is hard for an older person to read with this Kindle. Don't like that it is black and white. I found it hard to figure the book titles.  I bought it to replace the old kindle fire, but put it away and got the kindle fire back out. Will probably sell the kindle touch]
-	[Used to own a keyboard kindle and it finally stopped working. This one is not as comfortable to hold and the screen is definitely not glare-free. I am using the same light to read by as my old kindle but constantly have to adjust the position because of the glare.]
-	[it keeps changing type style and size in the middle of my reading without my doing anything. it is also very hard to get it to go to the correct screen to remove a item from the device. I am just not pleased with the way it controls.]
-	[My Kindle works great for the first eight months, then my battery quit charging completely. The only time I can use it is if it's plugged into a wall. As soon as I unplugged from the wall, it loses its charge. I'm very disappointed.]
-	[I find the touchscreen Kindle VERY annoying. If you put it down and anything touches it, the font size will change. I find the way to change pages (touching one half of the screen) to be very annoying as well. I miss my old kindle!]
-	[I like the Kindle but very disappointed that I cannot find a cover with a builtin light like my first Kindle.  The builtin light was very convenient when reading in a car or in bed at night. I am now regretting my purchase.]
-	[Responding for Mark Shoemaker - want to be able to reference page numbers more clearly, to search back and forth more easily, couldn't get the hang of touch screen, and prefer to read a print book.]
-	[Apparently "touch screen" means "if you breathe too hard while in the proximity of this device it will start flipping through random menus and fonts."]
-	[It is very slow turning pages or getting from one screen to the next. The graphics or display (don't know how to describe it) are terrible. Not a good value.]
-	[I like the old Kindle better with the buttons on the side for page turning and the less extensive features.]
-	[For the money I've in it I guess it's good.  Poor control features, almost like a step back in technology.]
-	[After 3 months of use, kindle cannot detect wifi around though there are many wifi router. It's too bad]
-	[I can’t keep my charger plugged in, the connection on the kindle is loose.]
-	[kindle cuts off and things on the screen disappear without warning.]
-	[Trouble getting to home page. Constantly having to reboot']
-	[The screen is frozen after one day of use. Cannot use it]
-	[I thought it had a light so I could read in the dark]
-	[I owned the first Kindle and it was much better.]
-	[I got my package in the mail the day it said it would come which is great but once I opened the package and plugged the keyboard in I quickly noticed that there was no back lights would not buy because of it]
-	[The mouse wheel squeaked from day one. Now, around 8 months in, the keyboard is falling apart and the back light is going out.  I know it's pretty cheap for a keyboard and mouse combo, but you'll be better served buying a quality item that will last you longer than this.]
-	[The mousewheel basically broke after a week of use. Now when you scroll with it, it jumps around scrolling up and down at the same time. The keyboard is nice, but to use the light you must hit Scroll Lock every time you turn on your computer.]
-	[The keyboard cannot be used easily without its back-lighting, so be ready to have it on constantly. The mouse is okay; however, the scroll wheel on it registers whatever direction it wants to, instead of the direction you scroll with it.]
-	[I bought the setup for my computer, the keyboard didn’t light up as shown (at all to be specific), also the mouse wheel is squeaky and not smooth at all. I still use the mouse, regrettably, the keyboard has been thrown out.]
-	[Lighting too dim to be useful. Font used on keys blocky no-traditional adds to viewing difficulty. Non-gamer, was looking for keyboard whose key faces would not wear off. Keys pretty much blank with illumination off.]
-	[The keyboard itself is great, but the Mouse3 button on the mouse quit working 2 weeks after I received the product. I tried to RMA, but the replacements never came, so I cannot re-review the product.]
-	[Would give full 5 stars, however the mouse's laser was DoA. The clicks and mouse wheel work but it will not move the cursor. Keyboard is great for the price, good product, just wish it worked.]
-	[Well almost got a year out of the mouse the right button went dead at the 8th month mark. Guess I got my monies worth out of it. Keyboard still going strong after losing its best friend.]
-	[keyboard leds need to be turned on at boot, while the mouse leds never turn off... what were they thinking? Otherwise functions like any cheap -$20 set.]
-	[The mouse completely crapped out on my within a month. Totally dissatisfied!]
-	[contrast from the colors ( both red and blue) are difficult to see sometimes. Don't like how you have to constantly turn on the lighting for the buttons.  The key action is nice though. Just wish the default for the lighting was "On" and the lettering and numbering was bigger.]
-	[Keyboard works fine. The scroll wheel on the mouse quit working properly after a week or two. Scrolling a page down would randomly scroll the page up in the middle of scrolling down. Got so frustrated I threw the mouse away. What can you expect when you pay under 30.00 for the combo.]
-	[If you are fine with being in the market for a new mouse within 3 months then get this. If you are only looking for a good entry level keyboard for gaming, get this keyboard. Otherwise do yourself a favor and keep looking because the mouse for me was defective in less than 3 months.]
-	[The blue backlighting on the keyboard makes it impossible to read the keys. Was going to return it if not for the $10 Amazon return fee so I ended up buying keyboard stickers to put on. Minor annoyance: mouse has some sharp edges underneath the left and right buttons.]
-	[The keyboard worked for a day, the mouse works but has a quirck with Windows that installs the wrong driver for it and makes the wheel work wonky.  It's not expensive enough to bother with sending back, so I am out what I paid... that's your risk for buying CHEAP stuff.]
-	[Red keyboard, but blue mouse.  Keyboard backlight has to be turned on each time computer is started, and no obvious (or easily read) key to do that (scr lk).  Simple once you know the key, but nobody else will know.  Looks good, but that's more of a personal choice.]
-	[Mouse doesn't fit the hand well but feels pretty solid. Keyboard is absolute garbage. Keys are extremely light and doesn't recognize multiple key pushes. Worst part is with the legs up on the keyboard it's barely at an angle. It is what it is,  a $30 combo..]
-	[When I received this, it looked and worked perfectly. After having it a while it still looks awesome, but the mouse wheel has begun squeaking and is driving me nuts. Really it should be a 2.5 star rating since the keyboard is still performing well.]
-	[Keyboard worked well, but the mouse was kinda not great. The wheel squeak became evident after less than a day of use, the left mouse button had some kind of weird raised bump on it that was distracting, and it just was kinda sub-par.]
-	[The mouse wheel started squeaking after just 10 days of use. The design of the mouse is very flat and not rounded, making it slightly uncomfortable compared to curved top mice. The keyboard sounds like a mechanical keyboard but not too loud.]
-	[The right shift key won't work unless I press it right in the middle. The mouse will automatically install 3rd party software (Tilt Mouse) and enabled it on start up. The only thing good about this set is the price and LEDs.]
-	[Keyboard looked cool, my daughter loved it, and the lights weren't too distracting...  BUT the shift key and Caps Lock keys didn't work.  Made it difficult to use, so I had to return it.  I put the money towards a higher quality board.]
-	[Bought it after the first 3 days the mouse wheel started to have jitters and would not scroll correctly which is very annoying. and I don't think it comes with warranty. but so far the keyboard works great.]
-	[Keyboard is fine, but the mouse scroll wheel is garbage, scroll down it will scroll back up for you while you are still rolling down same with the other way, or it will jump up and down the page]
-	[Amazon this laptop cannot work properly since the battery cannot charge.  From the time I put it on, the battery says 0% plugged in but not charging. I need a refund of my money onto my card.]
-	[I've had the laptop for 1 month and it has stopped working.  Screen is frozen and can't get it to turn on properly or get past the start up screen.]
-	[It worked well for a week then several different problems appeared including progressively slower starts and finally it would  show the logo on start up but nothing after just a blank screen]
-	[It showed up and when you move it there are things that shake in it the Wifi goes in and out of it There are just many issues with this computer.]
-	[4 excellent weeks with my new laptop, Now since Wednesday the laptop does not turn on. It does nothing, is dead. It was upgraded to Windows 10 without any problems. I was so happy but now does nothing. I loved my asus laptop, now I don't know what to do?  ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­]
-	[The laptop constantly turns off (battery issue)]
-	[This computer sucks, it takes forever to load, games are slow it came with two different anti-virus things, which was an issue, it is cheaply made and I hate it. If you want a PC buy a dell, ASUS's SUCK! there's a special place in hell for everyone involved with this computer.]
-	[I've had this laptop for not quite 2 years. If you enjoy having to restart your computer numerous times a day because it crashes, this is the laptop for you. If you prefer a stable functional computer I'd look elsewhere. First and last Asus computer.]
-	[This machine sucks.  It has a lag to it, any time I try to navigate, or type, or do ANYTHING.  The lag also affects anything I try to type while online. The Window's OS is a NIGHTMARE.  It is a cheap, useless computer, and an absolute waste of money.]
-	[it does not work at all, I have return it]
-	[Computer froze up and died literally minutes after I removed from packaging...I like Asus for some things but the plastic felt incredibly flimsy and almost looked like it was 3D printed. I thought the outer plastic would break...but the actual computer stopped working way before the plastic did!]
-	[Hard drive failed after having the laptop less than four months.  Current a claim in with ASUS we will see how they respond.  This is a no frills laptop but I expect it to actually last more than 4 months.  We will see how ASUS customer service responds to this, but I am not impressed so far.]
-	[Absolutely Horrible, I'm not sure whether Its Windows 8 that I don't like, or the actual computer.  Hard to say right now.  For the price I guess it’s a usable laptop, depends on your needs.  I don't like the touch pad very much.]
-	[I should have paid better attention to the reviews.  This computer is simple and full of all kinds of software that tries to get you to sign up for a trial.  And they don't want to go away.  Pop ups are constant on the Explorer.  Mozilla and Chrome are no better.  I wish I could return it.]
-	[Received my computer, started it up, and as I was using it realized it was definitely infected with Malware. If you don't know what this is, it is a hacker trying to get my information. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!!! Be careful buying these computers, check for malware when you receive it!!!!]
-	[USB ports aren't working, no DVD drive, could of done better if I would of shopped around. Found better laptops for the same price or just a few dollars more, disappointed with this machine. This is the first bad review I've ever wrote 99.99% I'm satisfied with shopping on amazon.]
-	[This computer just completely died on me while I was in class. It will not revive. I bought this computer less than one month ago. Not extremely happy as I have just lost all of my assignments I have done for class.  I have only used it for about two weeks since class started.]
-	[This was a disappointment I got this as a  gift for my mom and within a day we were having issues with it. its slow, it freezes and it shuts off on its own]
-	[It will not turn on, it just flashes. Returned to Asus for repairs and comes back doing the same thing. Sent it out the second time and it came back in the same condition.. They should give me a refund.  I will never buy a Asus product again.  Mary-Lou Kenyon]
-	[Pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and the battery light turned green. Pushed the power on and the lightbulb sensor light turned green but nothing else happens. No noise at all and the screen doesn't turn on...I'm very disappointed. Will be returning!]
-	[Windows 8 ruins what might have otherwise been a decent laptop. Ran sluggish out of the box and couldn't get it to downgrade to windows 7 (even with a new Windows 7 license key) Returned without hesitation and bought a laptop not running Windows 8.]
-	[I returned this product for a full refund.  Flimsy, extremely slow, hanging up constantly.  Our office IT professional couldn't get it booted up long enough to clear the hard drive.  Very disappointed.  But good for Amazon for taking it back!]
-	[I had to return this laptop because it ran at 50 to 75 cpu just on startup. Any program would freeze the computer due to lack of cpu power. Never buying another celery processor]
-	[Battery doesn't even charge only had this computer since Christmas. Been trying to reach the seller but it's not displaying one. The computer has been on the charge for 3 days and is not charging dies as soon as pull out the plug]
-	[Not what I expected.  It was taking over 6hours to upgrade to Windows 10, so I finally just shut it off.  No instruction book - very frustrated with this computer.  Cheap is what you pay for I guess. GOD I HATE THIS COMUTER!!!!]
